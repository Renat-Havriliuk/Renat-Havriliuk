### Hello people!

#####   It seems like it’s common here to write a bit about yourself. So, here it goes: I’m 19 and I really like programming. I believe it isn't necessary to list my stack of knowledge because I'm actively developing and expanding it. If you are interested in my skills, you can easily find out about them from my repositories.

#####   Actually, I’m friendly, but I don’t like to talk about myself without being self-critical. So, if you’re interested in chatting or working on something interesting together, feel free to message me!
